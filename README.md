# Recipe App!


This recipe app is a passion project of mine. I wanted to build something that I could use to get rid of the several random places I have recipe notes stashed away. As someone who cooks a LOT and definitely wants to remember the finer details, this was an easy choice. 

To view the app live, click here:

Then click `login`, and use the email `faust@example.com`
for the password, use `foostabubba`, all lower-case.

More features are in the works!
