# Recipe App

*To use, clone to your local - use rails db:seed to utilize current seed users.*

This recipe app is a passion project of mine. I wanted to build something that I could use to get rid of the several random places I have recipe notes stashed away. As someone who cooks a LOT and definitely wants to remember the finer details, this was an easy choice.
